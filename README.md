# Controllabel-GANs

### Project Statement:

Latent Space Navigation enhances the control of the edits on images by monitoring and analyzing the latent space involved with GANs. In this project, you will implement this method and generate qualitative results on datasets like CelebA, MITPlaces2, and take a step further in understanding controllable GANs. Finally, you will document your learnings and results in a report.

### Project Description:

Controllable semantic image editing enables a user to change entire image attributes with a few clicks, e.g., gradually making a summer scene look like it was taken in winter. Classic approaches for this task use a Generative Adversarial Net (GAN) to learn a latent space and suitable latent-space transformations.
